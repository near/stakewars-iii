### Description
We believe that in stake war the success of building the community is as important as running validators. So in this challenge, we would like you guys to make video tutorials about NEAR stake war and publish your video to the Internet to benefit latecomers.      

The topic of your video could be anything related to stake war, here are some suggestions that you might consider:
- A brief introduction of the NEAR nightshade sharding, chunk-only producer and stake war.
- How to setup a NEAR validator on major cloud service providers. (Maybe a step-by-step tutorial of the first 4 stake war challenges)
- Setting up a validator is easy, but how to make it stable and always up-to-date might require more efforts. Do you have any tips that could be shared with others?

We actually encourage you guys to record the video in your own language so that we could cover audiences from different regions around the world.

### Deliverable:
- A public accessable link to your video tutorial(s). You can upload it to any public platform as long as it's accessable by everyone.
- Please don't forget to put your mainnet NEAR account ID in the description of the video so that we could know which account to send the rewards :) .

### Acceptance criterias:
- The length of your video should be at least 3 minutes.
- The video must have audio commentary.
