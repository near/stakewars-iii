# Stake Wars: Episode III. Challenge 009
* Published on: 2022-07-28
* Submitted by: Open Shards Alliance
* Rewards: 15 Unlocked NEAR Points

This challenge has two objectives:
* Monitor uptime above 70% on ShardNet
* Open the RPC port 3030 for analytics / reporting

🎗️Tip: On MainNet, Uptime has to be greater than 95%, or you will be kicked for up to 3 epochs losing rewards and possibly delegators.

💡Did you know? If a validator issues a ping to join the network before being fully synced it is considered an attack on the network?

## Steps

We have launched a new validator scoreboard for ShardNet where you can monitor your uptime and metrics of your validator: [ShardNet Uptime Leaderboard](https://openshards.io/shardnet-uptime-scoreboard/)

### Objective 1 - Monitor uptime

* Check your current uptime and manage it to above 70% on ShardNet
* Fix issues with producing chunks.
See the [troubleshooting guide](https://github.com/near/stakewars-iii/blob/main/challenges/troubleshooting.md)
* Implement monitoring scripts 

### Objective 2 - Open Port 3030 for Diagnostic reporting

Check to see if PORT 3030 is open
```
sudo iptables -L | grep 3030
```
Open the port if not open
```
sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 3030 -j ACCEPT
```
Save the config for server restarts

You can use one of the 2 solutions:
##### Using `iptables-persistent`
```
sudo apt install iptables-persistent
```
or if already installed
```
sudo dpkg-reconfigure iptables-persistent
```

##### Using files
```
iptables-save > /etc/iptables/rules.v4
ip6tables-save > /etc/iptables/rules.v6
```

#### Validate the port is open by visiting
`http://<YOUR IP>:3030/status`

**NOTE:** _In some cases the port may also need to be opened in your cloud provider / datacenter firewall._

## Acceptance criteria:

* Validator reporting above 70%
* Port can be accessed publicly `http://<IP Address>:3030/status`

## Challenge submission

* Challenge URL: The link to your port 3030 port
* Challenge image: Screenshot of uptime from Leaderboard
