Create a cron task on the machine running node validator that allows ping to network automatically.

## Steps

Create a new file on /home/<USER_ID>/scripts/ping.sh

```
#!/bin/sh
# Ping call to renew Proposal added to crontab

export NEAR_ENV=shardnet
export LOGS=/home/<USER_ID>/logs
export POOLID=<YOUR_POOL_ID>
export ACCOUNTID=<YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID>

echo "---" >> $LOGS/all.log
date >> $LOGS/all.log
near call $POOLID.factory.shardnet.near ping '{}' --accountId $ACCOUNTID.shardnet.near --gas=300000000000000 >> $LOGS/all.log
near proposals | grep $POOLID >> $LOGS/all.log
near validators current | grep $POOLID >> $LOGS/all.log
near validators next | grep $POOLID >> $LOGS/all.log

```
Create a new crontab, running every 2 minutes:

```
crontab -e
0 */2 * * * sh /home/<USER_ID>/scripts/ping.sh
```

List crontab to see it is running:
```
crontab -l
```

Review your logs 

```
cat /home/<USER_ID>/logs/all.log
```

## Optional: Use croncat to create a ping task

[Cron.cat](https://cron.cat) is service running over NEAR Protocol that allows you to automatize the create a ping for validators. In fact, it is the more easy way to do it in testnet and mainnet. For stake wars III is now available to run the ping on Shardnet.
