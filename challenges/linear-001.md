# Data Science for Staking      

### Description:

Blockchain is big data. We believe that very interesting data insights could be found out through investigating staking data on NEAR. Please try to find out some valuable data from staking and validators and build a visualized data dashboard for everyone to access.

If you donâ€™t have anything in mind to start with, please consider the follow examples:
- Lifecycle performance of validators. (How many blocks have they produced, did they ever get kicked out, etc..)
- How does the reward APY change from epoch to epoch, what is affecting it?
- The token flow of big delegation whales. When did they decide to stake and when did they unstake.
- Historical data of the number of delegators (and delegation amount) on each validator node.

### Deliverable:
- A chartio-like data dashboard or a well-structured spreadsheet.
- A brief summary of what we could learn from those data and how NEAR can use those data to improve staking.

### Requirements:
- Please provide data insights other than what we can directly get from the NEAR explorer / NEAR wallet.
- As for the outcome, a visualized data dashboard is preferred, also a spreadsheet with well-structured data is also acceptable.
- What we can learn from the data actually matters, so please also provide a summary of how you interpret the data and how we can improve the NEAR system based on your work.

### Judging criterias:
- A clear and meaningful goal is set. (What kind of data are you investigating and what kind of result are you expecting) (2 points)
- Being able to correctly and effectively grab the data from indexer, rpc-node, etc. (2 points)
- Transform and aggregate the data to form the final result. (3 points)
- A straightforward data dashboard. (3 points)
