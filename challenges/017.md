* Rewards: Rewards for testnet bounty + 100 USD in $LiNEAR for top 3 submissions

## Description:
At this point we believe that all of you guys must have successfully deployed the chunk-only validator on one of the major cloud service providers like AWS.     
However, blockchain is  about decentralization,  we certainly don't want our infrastructures to be too centralized. Now lets try to deploy the validator with a decentralized cloud marketplace: [Akash](https://docs.akash.network/).
        
In this challenge, please try to create an account and deploy the chunk-only validator on Akash. In addition, to prove your work and also to pave the road for further developers, please record a video tutorial about how to deploy a validator on Akash step by step.

## Instructions:
- You may find this [guide](https://github.com/Dimokus88/near/blob/main/Guide_EN.md) created by Akash community helpful for you. But please deploy **testnet** rather than shardnet. 
- To get started with Akash, you can follow to this [doc](https://docs.akash.network/guides/cli/detailed-steps). Or join the discord server of Akash: http://discord.akash.network/
- If you need some Akash tokens to develop, please ask `Reason#9156` for help in NEAR stakewar discord channel.

**Please note that this challenge is targeted at Testnet, not Shardnet.** You can get testnet bounty if successfuly setup a validtor:
